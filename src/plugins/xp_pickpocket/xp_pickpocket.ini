# Log verbosity
# Messages from higher levels are always written. E.g. setting to 'info' will

# Possible values: none, error, warning, info, debug, trace
#
# default: info

# This improves the performance of the logger, but you may lose some log lines
# if the server crashes.
# false = lines are flushed on every write
# true  = lines are kept in memory and flushed when needed
